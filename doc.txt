Hi, This is a customizable parallax website for wedding purpose.

NOTE: I USED TIFFANY AND LEONE AS A RANDOM NAME TO MAKE WEBSITE MORE REAL;

How To Change:
    1. You can see the well organized CSS file "style.css";
    2. CSS FOR Snowfall Effects in the background stored in the file named "snowfall.css"
    3. I used jQuery To make website faster and more readble;
    4. All the images have their descriptive name. Just Change the image with the same name to customize .{Website Is Image Based}

Responsive:
    .I used XML attributes and meta tag to make it Responsive
    .So dont worry about making Responsive. You can put Content in absolute value [px,pc,vh];
    .It will automatically render for particular device .(^-^)
